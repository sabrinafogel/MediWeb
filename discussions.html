      <pr>  Hello I’m a 21 y/o named Aster and I was first diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes when I was 14. I’m currently on novolog and Lantus. I use a Dexcom G6 for my blood glucose censors.</pr><br><br>
      <pr>  I was looking if anyone had any experiences with the Omnipod pump? My endocrinologist has been trying to switch me over for months but I’m still not sure if I want to. Would love to hear some advice/experiences from anyone who’s tried it! Thanks (:</pr>

      <pr>Hello fellow warriors!
I am Sneha and I have been diagnosed with Crohn’s Disease 2 years ago and I here’s my letter I wrote to my disease: 
Dear Crohn’s, 
You came rushing into my life uninvited, you took a lot from me without my permission. 
You broke me into pieces, without instructions to fix myself. 
You left me with a lot of pain and clueless, when I did not ask you to. 
But….
You taught me a lot, things I never thought I would need to know. 
You taught me to get back up, put myself together and made me resilient. 
You taught me to believe in myself and to trust that all will be fine eventually though it might take some time.
I can appreciate all the change you brought to my personality but I will always resent you a little. 
Sincerely, 
Sneha(your fellow Crohnie)</pr>

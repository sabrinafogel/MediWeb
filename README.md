# MediWeb
![MediWeb](https://github.com/sabrinafogel/MediWeb/blob/main/medi.png)

A GraceHacks 2022 project, created by Sabrina Fogel, Regan Miller, and Sneha Yalavarti
## Inspiration
Being someone who has been in a place of confusion and frustration after a medical diagnosis, I felt lost and miserable. I really wanted to have a place where I could read about other people like me and see how they are living their lives and managing their chronic illness. -Sneha Yalavarti
## What it does
MediWeb lets you meet people that have the same diagnosis as you and also allows you to share your story and any questions you might have. It is a place for you to build a community and can also possibly be a place for you to connect with medical professionals.
## How we built it
We built it using CSS, JavaScript, and HTML in Replit.
## Challenges we ran into
As it was our first time using these languages, we had a hard time figuring out what we needed to do. Once we got that set up, we had a hard time trying to set up a database for some our services due to the way Replit is set up. If we had more time we would have liked to make the formatting ans the user experience better and have more services like having verified medical professionals on the website. In the future we would also like to build an app and extend MediWeb to all platforms.
## Accomplishments we're proud of
We are all super proud of this website and the amount of work we put in this weekend.
## What we learned
We learned what a Hackathon was, as well as new programming languages!
## What's next for MediWeb
Correcting roadblocks (Implement databases to store user information, as well as discussion posts, Add live chat functionality between users, Correct minor formatting errors)
New implementations (Verification of medical professionals, Inclusion of images into discussion posts, Mobile application as well as website?)

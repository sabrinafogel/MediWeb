      <div class = "them">Them:  Oh hi, I am currently still looking into it but I do recommend reading some research articles online, I found them helpful.<br></div>

      <div class = "me">Me: Oh okay, I was going to talk to my doctor about it. But my current medication works well for me but I’m just looking into more options. <br></div>

<div class = "them">Them: okay, if you don’t mind me asking what medication are you on currently?<br></div>

<div class = "me">Me: I am on [medication name], what about you?<br></div>

<div class = "them">Them: I’m on the same medication too but with a couple supplements.<br></div> 

<div class = "me">Me: Ya I was on supplements previously but I’ve gotten off them since I have been doing better. <br></div>
